## 📖 About Me

I'm an analytics engineer with a passion for scalable data infrastructure, rigorous statistical analysis, and bridging the gap between data engineering and business intelligence. My work spans the complete data lifecycle: from pipeline orchestration and data quality to predictive modeling and actionable insights.

I thrive at the intersection of:
- **Analytics Engineering**: ETL orchestration, Feature engineering, statistical modeling, data transformation & validation
- **Advanced Data Analytics**: Predictive modeling, probability distributions, market analysis, edge detection

## 🗻 What Drives My Work

I'm focused on the **data lifecycle** — understanding how raw data flows through systems, gets transformed into trustworthy analytical assets, and ultimately drives decisions. My projects reflect:

- **Rigor**: Statistical validation, cross-validation, backtesting, and probability calibration
- **Scalability**: Pipelines that grow from single-machine to distributed systems without redesign
- **Reliability**: Idempotent operations, error handling, monitoring, and production readiness
- **Clarity**: Clean architecture, documented assumptions, and transparent trade-offs
